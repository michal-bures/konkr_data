## Act dismissive about minor transgressions
#### a) from position of strength

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, friendly
- I needed to take that, I'm sure you understand.
- Surely you can spare a bit of land for me.
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab thtiny piece of land over here... there we go, now I'm good!

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, hostile
- I needed that land, going to do anything about it?
- Yeah, yeah. I grabbed some of your land, big deal.

- Look I just need a bit more land, so have mercy?
- Uhh, surely you didn't care about that tiny bit of land?
- I just needed that land, ok? Please don't be mad.
- Eh, can you let it slide just this once?

> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, hostile
- I'm in trouble now, aren't I.
- Come on, you have better things to do.
- Come on, let this slide for once.

### No good reason
> invading, caused major damage, stronger, was friendly
- I... Don't know what to say.
- Oh. This is awkward.
- Oops... I guess I got a bit carried away there.

> invading, caused major damage, was angered by nature, not hostile
- What can I say, sometimes I just can't help myself.
- Oops, I guess that was too tempting.
- Hehe... sorry, I just couldn't resist.
- You were kind of asking for this one, you know?

> invading, caused major damage, stronger, not hostile
- Nothing personal, but you were kind of in the way.
- Sorry, have to look after my own interests.
