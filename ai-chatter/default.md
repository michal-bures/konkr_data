## 2. React to unprovoked player attacks

## Major damage

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered major damage, was ally
- You treacherous bastard!
- How could you!
- Should have seen this coming!
- You'll pay for that!
- Treachery!
- Outrageous!
- You... You!
- I have no words for what you just did.
- Disgraceful!

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered major damage, was friendly
- I knew you couldn't be trusted.
- So that's how it is.
- Of course you would do that.

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered major damage, is stronger
- Ohh! Ok, let's dance!
- Ha, you're going to regret that!

### Minor damage

- Really? You sure you want to do that?
- My patience has its limits, you know?
- You're really pushing it, you know?
- Now you're really pushing your luck...
- Testing my patience, are you?

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered minor damage, is friendly
- Hey! What was that for?
- What the hell?
- What was that?

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered minor damage, is neutral, is stronger
- Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
- I did not allow you to take that!
- You just can't help yourself, can you...

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered minor damage, is hostile, is stronger
- You will regret that. 
- No, I will not let this slide.
- You're going to pay for that.

> was just attacked, was at peace, suffered minor damage, is not friendly
- I knew this was coming...
- I knew you couldn't be trusted...
- I knew you were up to no good...

## 3. Explain your own unprovoked attacks

### Try to explain away minor transgression

#### a) from position of strength

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is stronger, is friendly
- I needed to take that, I'm sure you understand.
- Surely you can spare a bit of land for me.
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab this tiny piece of land over here... there we go, now I'm good!
- Don't worry, we're still good, just needed that land over there.

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is stronger, is neutral
- I had to take that land, no need to overreact.
- I needed that land, don't make a fuss.
- Don't worry, just needed a bit more land.
- I just needed that land, ok?

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is stronger, is hostile
- I needed that land, going to do anything about it?
- Yeah, yeah. I grabbed some of your land, big deal.
- Look, I take what I want, and I wanted that land.

#### b) from equal position

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is similar strength, is friendly
- I can have a bit more land, right?
- Surely you can spare a bit of land for me? Please?
- See I really needed that bit of land. Don't be mad!
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab this tiny piece of land over here... there we go, now I'm good!

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is similar strength, is neutral
>

#### c) from desperate position

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is much weaker, is friendly
- Look I really had to take that land, forgive me please?
- Oh hi, don't be mad please? I just really needed to take that.
- I can have a bit more land, right my friend?

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is much weaker, is neutral
- Oh crap you noticed? Look I just need a bit more land, so have mercy?
- Uhh, surely you didn't care about that tiny bit of land?
- I just needed that land, ok? Please don't be mad.
- Eh, can you let it slide just this once?

> caused minor damage, was at peace, is much weaker, is hostile
- Oh #$@& he noticed.
- Oh crap, I'm in trouble now, aren't I.
- Come on, you have better things to do.

### Justify trying to stop the player from dominating
> did just attack, was at peace, was provoked by player dominance, is not hostile, is not weaker
- Nothing personal, but you were getting a too powerful for your own good.
- Look I'm sorry, but somebody had to clip your wings a bit.
- Sorry, you were just getting too big for comfort there.
- Apologies, had to reign you in a little there.
- Sorry, somebody had to put a stop to your sprawl.
- Sorry, you were getting a bit too powerful for your own good.
- Sorry, someone had to put your ambitions in check. 

> did just attack, was at peace, was provoked by player dominance, is friendly
- I'm sorry it came to this, but you're scaring me at this point!
- I didn't want to do this, but you're just growing way too powerful.

> did just attack, was at peace, was provoked by player dominance, is weaker
- You can't be allowed to wield this kind of power.
- I won't just sit here and watch you dominate.
- Someone had to try to stop your unchecked expansion.
- I will not just wait here for my inevitable demise.
- I will not go silently into the night.
- Someone has to put a stop to your sprawl before it's too late.
- You can't be allowed to get away with such unchecked expansion.

### Justify based on past grievances
> did just attack, was at peace, was provoked by player credit, is not hostile
- There, now we're even.
- You know you deserved that.
- Life has a way of balancing things out, doesn't it.

> did just attack, was at peace, was provoked by player credit, is hostile
- You had that one coming.
- You reap what you sow.

### Justify by desperation
> did just attack, was at peace, was provoked by combative nature, is much weaker, is not hostile
- Sorry, I had to do something!
- Sorry, I'm just kind of desperate over here.
- Sorry, I didn't know what else to do.

### No good reason
> caused major damage, was at peace, is stronger, is not hostile
- Nothing personal, but you were kind of in the way.
- Sorry, have to look after my own interests.
