- Goddamnit, this is hopeless.
- Damn, what's the point of fighting anymore.
- This is bloody hopeless.
- Who am I kidding, I'm done.
- Damn, this is getting too depressing.
- What's the point of fighting anymore?

- What, am I supposed to be your pet or something now?
- Very funny...
- Sigh... Done gloating?

## 3. React to unprovoked player attacks

### Major damage

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, friendly, not weaker, angry reaction
- Fine, maybe just this once, I'll let you get away with this.
- Uh... I'm sure you had a good reason for this?
- Eh, I'm sure you had a good reason for this?
- So what was this supposed to accomplish exactly?
- What the... Are you done?
- My patience has its limits, you know?
- I guess I still owe you one, but don't push it.
- Oh, I get it. This is your way of saying "hello", isn't it?
- I'm not mad, just disappointed.
- You're joking, right?
- With allies like these, who needs enemies...

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, friendly, angry reaction
- Wait what?...
- I don't understand...
- Um, what is the meaning of this?
- Eh, what are you doing?...
- Wait no! Stop!
- What are you doing?
- What's going on here?!
- Hey, what did I do to deserve this?
- What? No!
- Hold on, what is this?!

- So that's how it is.
- You want to play it like that eh?
- Of course you would do that.
- I don't know what I expected.
- This is why we can’t have nice things.
- Should have seen it coming!
- You just made yourself an enemy.
- Of course, I'm not even surprised.
- Say hello to my complete lack of surprise.
- I knew you were trouble.
- How disappointing.
- Should have seen that coming.
- This is going to end badly for you.
- It didn't have to be this way.

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, had common enemy, angry reaction
- Really? You chose to focus on ME?
- What?! I'm not the one you should be worried about!
- You're making a mistake here!
- Wow! You must really want the other guy to win.
- Wow! How stupid of you.
- This is why we can’t have nice things.
- A very poor choice, a fatal mistake even.
- Oh. How disappointing.
- Sigh... This is going to end badly for both of us.
- Wow. This is really disappointing.
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me...
- Seriously? Don't we have a bigger problem to worry about?

> invaded, suffered major damage, weaker, was weaker, was not hostile, common enemy, angry reaction
- Pick a fight with someone your own size!
- I could have helped, you know?
- Sure, pick on the little guy.
- How brave of you...
- How very brave of you... 
- Seriously? You're picking on me?
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me...
- You sure I'm the one you want to be fighting right now?
- Don't you have bigger problems to worry about?
- You sure I'm the enemy here? 
- You think I am the enemy here?

> invaded, suffered major damage, had common enemy, angry reaction
- Don't you have bigger problems then me?
- Why me? Why now?!
- Wow! You must really want the other guy to win.
- Wow! How stupid of you.
- You're making a mistake here!
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me...
- You sure I'm the one you want to be fighting right now?

### Minor damage

- Careful now...
- Really? You sure you want to do that?
- My patience has its limits, you know?
- You're really pushing it, you know?
- Now you're really pushing your luck...
- Testing my patience, are you?
- Sure, be a nuisance, see where that gets you.
- Last chance to behave. Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hey, be nice!
- You really should stop before things get ugly.
- You like living dangerously, huh?
- You sure you want to make me angry?
- Maybe you should think twice about this.
- Don't do something you will regret.
- I hope you realize my benevolence has limits.
- You sure you want to poke this particular hornets nest?
- Fancy testing the limits of my patience?
- You are walking a very thin line, my friend.
- If you keep pushing me, I'll have no choice but to push back.

> invaded, suffered minor damage, friendly, angry reaction

- What the hell?
- What was that?

- Hey, that's not yours!
- For real?
- Hey, that's not cool!
- That's not nice!
- Keep pushing me, and I'll have to push back.

> invaded, suffered minor damage, neutral, stronger, angry reaction
- Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
- I did not allow you to take that!
- Looking for trouble, huh?
- You're really pushing it, you know?
- Listen here you little...
- You have a death wish?
- Why you little...
- Try that again and see what happens. 
- Think twice before you try something like that again.
- Last warning: Back off.
- Want me to end you?
- One more stunt like that, and it's over for you.
- Your arrogance will be your demise.
- I am not one to be toyed with.
- I shall not tolerate such insolence.
- Do not test me.
- Don't tempt fate.
- Do you have a death wish or something?

> invaded, suffered minor damage, hostile, stronger, angry reaction
- You will regret that. 
- No, I will not let that slide.
- You're going to pay for that.
- Looking for more trouble, huh?
- Thanks for reminding me that it's time to end you.
- Oh right, you're still here. Let's fix that.
- I guess you haven't learned your lesson yet.
- I've had enough of you.
- Don't worry, I'll get to you soon enough.
- Prepare for the reckoning.

> invaded, suffered minor damage, not friendly, angry reaction
- I knew this was coming...
- I knew you couldn't be trusted.
- I knew you were up to no good.
- I always get the worst neighbours.

- And here it is... No one can be trusted these days.
- You want a fight?
- Hey! Not cool!
- I'm warning you...
- I knew you'll be trouble.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Can't we all just get along for once?

- Sorry, somebody had to put a stop to your sprawl.
- Sorry, you were getting a bit too powerful for your own good.
- Sorry, someone had to put your ambitions in check.
- Sorry, but someone had to put a limit on your greed.

- You have to admit, you were becoming a bit too dangerous for anyone around.
- Sorry, it was time to bring you down to Earth a bit.
- Sorry, it was time someone cut your wings before you flew too high.
- Look, I couldn't sit by and let your ambitions ruin everyone else.

- Someone had to try to stop your expansion.
- I will not just stand by waiting to be crushed.
- Someone has to put a stop to your reign before it's too late.
- You can't be allowed to get away with such unchecked expansion.

## Act dismissive about minor transgressions
#### a) from position of strength

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, friendly
- I needed to take that, I'm sure you understand.
- Surely you can spare a bit of land for me.
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab this tiny piece of land over here... there we go, now I'm good!
- Don't worry, we're still good, just needed that land over there.
- Sorry for the land grab, but you were kind of in my way.
- Sorry, but that little chunk of land over there just caught my eye.
- Oops, did you need that land? I'm sure you can spare it.
- I'm sure you can spare a bit of land for a good friend, right?
- Oh, was that yours? Sorry!

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, neutral
- I had to take that land, no need to overreact.
- I needed that land, don't make a fuss.
- Don't worry, just needed a bit more land.
- I just needed that land, ok?
- Come on, don't make a big deal out of this.
- Hey, no hard feelings, right?
- Relax, it's not like I'm trying to wipe you off the map or anything.
- Just expanding a bit, don't take it personally now.
- Calm down, it's just a bit of land.
- It's not like you needed all that land anyway, right?

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, hostile
- I needed that land, going to do anything about it?
- Yeah, yeah. I grabbed some of your land, big deal.
- Look, I take what I want, and I wanted that land.
- You should be glad I didn't take more.
- Oh, right, that was your land I guess. Well, no longer.
- You didn't need that land anyway.
- I'm not apologizing for taking what I want. 
- Your fault for not defending that.
- Pff, cry me a river.
- Consider yourself lucky I didn't take more.
- Yeah no, that land is mine now, deal with it.
- I'm just getting started.

- See I really needed that bit of land. Don't be mad!
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab this tiny piece of land over here... there we go, now I'm good!
- Oops, did you care about that piece of land? Sorry!
- Sorry for that little land grab, but that spot was really important to me.
- Ah, don't be so sour about it. Just a small piece of land.

> invading, caused minor damage, similar strength, neutral
- Hey, nothing personal, just needed that land.
- You know I needed that land, right? No need to get mad over it.
- I just needed that land, okay?
- Just a teensy tiny little land grab. No hard feelings, right?
- Ahem, let's not make this a big deal?
- If I say I'm sorry, will you leave me alone?
- I'm sorry, ok? I just needed that land.
- Sorry, had to take that. Let's not dwell on it.
- Come on, you know I didn't mean it.
- Don't be overly dramatic about this now, it's just a little bit of land.
- Sorry, I need to expand somewhere too!
- I need that land, sorry.
- Surely you don't care about that teensy-weensy little incursion?
- Just look at that land, it practically begged me to take it.

> invading, caused minor damage, similar strength, hostile
- Let's not start a big fight over this just yet?
- Pff, like you care about a few bits of land.
- Want to start something bigger over this? Because I'm ready.
- Yeah, that's mine now.
- I can do much worse if you want.
- You should be glad that's all I took for now.
- Come on, that's barely worth fighting over.
- Just taking some land, but we can have a real war too if you want!
- No, I'm not done.
- Looks like you're giving away land for free. I'll take it!
- I mostly just needed that land, hurting you was a nice bonus though.
- You deserved to lose that land.
- I'm just getting started.
- This is just the beginning.

#### c) from weaker position

> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, friendly
- Look I really had to take that land, forgive me please?
- Oh hi, don't be mad please? I just really needed to take that.
- I can have a bit more land, right my friend?
- Oh no... Don't be mad!
- Oh crap, he noticed. I mean hi, sorry about that!
- Oh, you saw that? Sorry!
- Please forgive me, that piece of land is really important to me.
- I promise I will give it back later, don't hate me?
- You said I can take that, right? Or did I misunderstand?
- Sorry, I'll make it up to you, I swear! 
 
> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, neutral
- Look I just need a bit more land, so have mercy?
- Uhh, surely you didn't care about that tiny bit of land?
- I just needed that land, ok? Please don't be mad.
- Eh, can you let it slide just this once?
- I'm sorry, okay? I just needed that land.
- Surely you have bigger things to worry about than little me?
- So, uh, maybe I overstepped a little? Didn't mean to!
- Look, I didn't mean to steal your land, it just kind of happened. 
- I promise I'm not going to take any more land, so can we call a truce?
- I suppose I was being a bit greedy, sorry.

> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, hostile
- I'm in trouble now, aren't I.
- Come on, you have better things to do.
- Come on, let this one slide.
- Huh, I guess you actually noticed. Unfortunate.
- I guess this might have been a mistake.
- Come on, you have bigger things to worry about.
- It's not like you'll miss that land anyway.
- Don't you have more important things to worry about?
- Come on, don't pretend you cared about that bit of land.

### No good reason
> invading, caused major damage, stronger, was friendly
- I... Don't know what to say.
- Oh. This is awkward.
- Oops... I guess I got a bit carried away there.

- Oh dear. I may have accidentally... Sorry!
- Whoops. Guess I should've thought twice before doing that...
- Oh. Oh no. I'm so sorry.
- That... was not supposed to happen.
- Oh my. I guess saying sorry doesn't quite cut it here, does it.
- Oh no. Sometimes I just do things without thinking.

> invading, caused major damage, was angered by nature, not hostile
- What can I say, sometimes I just can't help myself.
- Oops, I guess that was too tempting.
- Hehe... sorry, I just couldn't resist.
- You were kind of asking for this one, you know?
- Sorry, it was kind of an impulse decision.
- Well what can I say, you were just too easy to conquer.
- I mean just look at that land, it practically begged me to take it.
- See I'm a conqueror, it's what I do.
- For glory!
- Ah, the thrill of conquest.
- To the victors go the spoils!
- Conquer and plunder, that's just how I like it.

> invading, caused major damage, stronger, not hostile
- Nothing personal, but you were kind of in the way.
- Sorry, have to look after my own interests.
- Sorry, but you were kind of a nuisance.
- Oh, did I just ruin your day? Wasn't really my intention, but oh well.
- How do I put it... You were a bit of an obstacle there.
- Don't take it personally, just had to do what was best for my kingdom.
- Sorry for trampling over your lands, but sometimes these things just happen.
- Sorry for taking over your lands, but hey, now you have less to worry about!
- Sorry, just figured I can make better use of that land.
- Sorry for ruining your plans, but I have my own to take care of.
