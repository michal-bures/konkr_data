## 1. Surrender

> surrendering, hostile
- Screw this, I give up.
- Goddamnit, this is hopeless.
- This is bloody hopeless.
- Who am I kidding, I'm done.
- Damn, this is getting too depressing.
- What's the point of fighting anymore?
- You've beaten me.
- Oh well.
- So be it.
- I'm defeated.
- Well, that's that.
- Give me a break...
- Fine, you win.
- Yeah, this is going nowhere.

> surrendering, friendly
- Well played!
- Congratulations!
- I concede.
- I acknowledge my defeat.
- Very impressive.
- Well done.
- I knew you could do it!

> surrendering, not hostile

- Fine, I give up.
- Alright, you got me.
- I see I was outmatched.
- Okay, you win.
- Well, I'm beat.
- Yeah, this is going nowhere.
- Whatever.

> surrender declined, much weaker, hostile
- Fine! I'll go down swinging!
- Bastard! Come at me then!
- Damn you!
- To the death it is.
- I'll gladly fight this to the bitter end.
- Good, I didn't REALLY want to surrender anyway!
- Fine then. Bring it!
- Let's get on with it then.
- You tyrant.

> surrender declined, much weaker, truce, not hostile
- Hey, thanks for sparing me! You ARE sparing me, right?
- Wait, why am I still alive?
- I have no idea what's going on right now...
- What, am I supposed to be your pet or something now?
- Very funny...
- Sigh... Done gloating? 
- So uh, what is this, anyway?
- So now you expect me to do what exactly? 
- Waiting for me to compliment you or something?

## 2. When furious, simply throw insults

### When much weaker
> furious, much weaker, caused major damage, did not suffer major damage
- Ahahahaha! That felt good!
- Didn't expect that, did you?!
- Now THAT was satisfying.
- Didn't think I could still bite, did you?
- Take that!
- Hah! That's what you get!
- You like that?! Hahaha!
- Who's the big guy now?!

> furious, much weaker, was not hostile, suffered major damage, did not cause major damage, angry reaction

- Ugh!
- Why you!

- Ugh...
- Grrr...
- Screw you.

- Damn, I'm good.

> furious, much stronger, fighting
- Came to beg for mercy?
- Time to say goodbye.
- We both know it's over.
- It's too late for apologies!
- You'll die for this. 
- I've had enough of you.
- You're done for.
- It's time to end this.
- Your defiance will not go unpunished.

> furious, stronger, suffered major damage, did not cause major damage, angry reaction
- Hey, that hurt! I'll get you for that!
- You'll pay for that!
- Ow! Insolent little...
- Trust me, you're not getting away with this!
- Ohhh NOW you've done it!
- How dare you!
- This is going to cost you!
- You picked the wrong fight!
- This will not go unpunished!
- For that, I'll make it slow and painful.
- Mark my words, I'll have your head.

> furious, stronger, truce
- Just you wait...
- You'll pay for that, you know.
- Don't worry, I'll get to you soon enough.
- You're next.
- Insolent little...
- Your time will come.
- I will have my vengeance in due time.

- Yaaaah!
- Yes, I can do this!
- AHA! I got this!
- Hahahaha! Do your worst!
- Yeehaaaw!
- Bring it on! 
- Yeah, that's right!

## 3. React to unprovoked player attacks

### Major damage

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, friendly, not weaker, angry reaction
- Fine, maybe just this once, I'll let you get away with this.
- Uh... I'm sure you had a good reason for this?
- So what was this supposed to accomplish exactly?
- What the... Are you done?
- My patience has its limits, you know?
- I guess I still owe you one, but don't push it.
- Oh, I get it. This is your way of saying "hello", isn't it?
- I'm not mad, just disappointed.
- You're joking, right?
- With allies like these, who needs enemies...
- That was just a prank, right? Right?

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, friendly, angry reaction
- Wait, what...?
- I don't understand...
- Um, what is the meaning of this?
- Eh, what are you doing...?
- Wait, no! Stop!
- What are you doing?!
- What's going on here?!
- Hey, what did I do to deserve this?
- What? No!
- Hold on, what is this?!
- Are you kidding me...?
- Can we talk about this?

> invaded, suffered major damage, was ally, not friendly, angry reaction
- How could you!
- Should have seen that coming!
- You'll pay for that!
- You betray me?!
- This is outrageous!
- You... You!
- I have no words for what you just did.
- Disgraceful!
- You just made yourself an enemy.
- It didn't have to be this way. 
- A shameful display.
- Your dishonor will not be forgotten!
- You treacherous snake!
- It's a dog-eat-dog world, isn't it?
- What an appalling disgrace.
- My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
- Unbelievable!
- You will regret the day you crossed me!

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, not friendly, angry reaction
- I knew you couldn't be trusted.
- So that's how it is.
- You want to play it like that, huh?
- Of course you would do that.
- I don't know what I expected.
- This is why we can’t have nice things.
- Should have seen that coming.
- You just made yourself an enemy.
- Of course. I'm not even surprised.
- Say hello to my complete lack of surprise.
- I knew you were trouble.
- How disappointing.
- This is going to end badly for you.
- It didn't have to be this way.

> invaded, suffered major damage, was friendly, had common enemy, angry reaction
- Really? You chose to focus on ME?
- What?! I'm not the one you should be worried about!
- You're making a mistake here!
- Wow! You must really want the other guy to win.
- How stupid of you...
- This is why we can’t have nice things.
- A very poor choice, a fatal mistake even.
- Oh. How disappointing.
- Sigh... This is going to end badly for both of us.
- Wow. This is really disappointing.
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me...
- Seriously? Don't we have a bigger problem to worry about?
- Great strategy, see how it works out for ya!

> invaded, suffered major damage, weaker, was weaker, was not hostile, common enemy, angry reaction
- Pick a fight with someone your own size!
- I could have helped, you know?
- Sure, pick on the little guy.
- How very brave of you... 
- Seriously? You're picking on ME?
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me...
- You sure I'm the one you want to be fighting right now?
- Don't you have bigger problems to worry about?
- You sure I'm the threat here? 

> invaded, suffered major damage, had common enemy, angry reaction
- Don't you have bigger problems then me?
- Why me? Why now?!
- Wow! You must really want the other guy to win.
- How stupid of you.
- You're making a mistake here!
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me...
- You sure I'm the one you want to be fighting right now?
- Well, that was dumb.
- Seriously? You choose to attack me NOW?

> invaded, suffered major damage, stronger, angry reaction
- Ohhh! Okay, let's dance!
- Ha, you're going to regret that!
- You'll pay for that!
- Oh man, you have no idea what you just signed up for.
- Okay, it's on now!
- Ohhh, someone's just asking for trouble!
- I'm going to make you regret this! 
- You'll wish you had never done that!
- You're asking for a world of hurt!
- Someone is going to get a royal beating today.
- Oh, you want to play it like that?
- Oh wow, that was a terrible mistake.
- A fateful error.
- And this is where it all goes wrong for you.
- How dare you challenge me?
- You'll pay dearly for that.
- You know this won't end well for you.
- How foolish of you to challenge me.
- Making a big mistake right now.
- Oh, hell no!

> invaded, suffered major damage, similar strength, angry reaction
- Bastard!
- You'll pay for that!
- Should have seen that coming, I suppose...
- That's the best you can do?
- Fine, let's dance.
- Curse you!
- You're going to regret this. 
- Alright, you asked for it.
- You'll pay dearly for that.
- This won't end well for you.
- Prepare for your doom!
- Let the fun begin. 
- Challenge accepted.
- So be it.

### Minor damage
> invaded, suffered minor damage, friendly, stronger, angry reaction
- Careful now...
- Really? You sure you want to do that?
- My patience has its limits, you know.
- You're really pushing it, you know.
- Now you're really pressing your luck...
- Testing my patience, are you?
- Sure, be a nuisance. See where that gets you.
- Last chance to behave. Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hey, be nice!
- You really should stop before things get ugly.
- You like living dangerously, don't you?
- You sure you want to make me angry?
- Maybe you should think twice about this.
- Don't do something you'll regret.
- I hope you realize my benevolence has limits.
- You sure you want to poke this particular hornet's nest?
- Fancy testing the limits of my patience?
- You are walking a very thin line, my friend.
- If you keep pushing me, I'll have no choice but to push back.

> invaded, suffered minor damage, friendly, angry reaction
- Hey! What was that for?
- What the hell?
- What was that?
- Like, seriously?
- Oh, come on...
- Hey, cut it out!
- Stop that!
- Hey, I needed that land!
- Hey, that's not yours!
- For real?
- That's not cool!
- Keep pushing me and I'll have to push back.

> invaded, suffered minor damage, neutral, stronger, angry reaction
- Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
- I did not allow you to take that!
- Looking for trouble, huh?
- You're really pushing it, you know.
- Listen here you little...
- Why you little...
- Try that again and see what happens. 
- Think twice before you try something like that again.
- Last warning: back off.
- Want me to end you?
- One more stunt like that and it's over for you.
- Your arrogance will be your demise.
- I am not one to be toyed with.
- I shall not tolerate such insolence.
- Do not test me.
- Don't tempt fate.
- Do you have a death wish or something?

> invaded, suffered minor damage, hostile, stronger, angry reaction
- You will regret that. 
- No, I will not let that slide.
- You're going to pay for that.
- Looking for more trouble, huh?
- Thanks for reminding me that it's time to end you.
- Oh right, you're still here. Let's fix that.
- I guess you haven't learned your lesson yet.
- I've had enough of you.
- Don't worry, I'll get to you soon enough.
- Prepare for the reckoning.

> invaded, suffered minor damage, not friendly, angry reaction
- I figured this was coming...
- I knew you couldn't be trusted.
- I knew you were up to no good.
- I always get the worst neighbours.
- You've made a grave mistake, my friend.
- If you press me, I'll make sure you regret it.
- Go ahead, keep messing with me. See what it gets you.
- And here it is... No one can be trusted these days.
- You want a fight?
- Hey! Not cool!
- I'm warning you...
- I knew you'd be trouble.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Can't we all just get along for once?

### Justify trying to stop the player from dominating
> invading, was angered by dominance, not hostile, not weaker
- Nothing personal, but you were getting too powerful for your own good.
- Look, I'm sorry, but somebody had to clip your wings a bit.
- Sorry, you were just getting too big for comfort there.
- Apologies, had to rein you in a little there.
- Sorry, somebody had to put a stop to your sprawl.
- You were getting a bit too powerful for your own good.
- Someone had to put your ambitions in check.
- Sorry, but someone had to put a limit on your greed. 
- Look, you got a bit too big for your britches there, my friend.
- What can I say, it was time someone tamed that ambition of yours a little.
- You have to admit, you were becoming a bit too dangerous for anyone around.
- Sorry, it was time to bring you down to Earth a bit.
- Sorry, it was time someone cut your wings before you flew too high.
- Look, I couldn't sit by and let your ambitions ruin everyone else.
- It was a tough decision, but someone had to step up and stop your expansion.
- You needed to be taken down a peg or two. You understand.

- I'm sorry, but you've grown too dangerous.
- I'm not proud of this, but it was time to act.

> invading, was angered by dominance
- You can't be allowed to wield this kind of power.
- I won't just sit here and watch you crush everyone.
- Someone had to try to stop your expansion.
- I will not just stand by waiting to be crushed.
- Someone has to put a stop to your reign before it's too late.
- You can't be allowed to get away with such unchecked expansion.
- Somebody has to resist you.
- It's time to put your ambitions in check.
- It's time to rein you in a bit.
- Your greed must be put in check.
- You can't expect the rest of us to just roll over.
- Your unchecked expansion simply cannot continue.
- Did you expect me to just sit here and watch you take over everything? 
- Oh, did you expect me to just wait for my turn to be crushed?
- Someone had to stand up for those who can't.
- You must know that I can't let you just roll over everyone. 

### Justify based on past grievances
> invading, was angered by credit, caused major damage, not hostile, common enemy
- I know we have bigger problems now, but you had this coming.
- Just because we have a common enemy doesn't mean I've forgotten what you did.
- Sorry, common enemy or not, I had a score to settle with you.

- Yeah, I might have doomed us there, but damn was it worth it.
- This may have been a mistake, but damn did it feel good.
- Sure, we might be doomed now, but at least I got my revenge!
- If you wanted me to focus on our common foe, maybe you shouldn't have messed with me.

## Act dismissive about minor transgressions
#### a) from position of strength

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, friendly
- I needed to take that, I'm sure you understand.
- Surely you can spare a bit of land for me.
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab this tiny piece of land over here... There we go, now I'm good!
- Don't worry, we're still good, just needed that land over there.
- Sorry for the land grab, but you were kind of in my way.
- Sorry, but that little chunk of land over there just caught my eye.
- Oops, did you need that land? I'm sure you can spare it.
- I'm sure you can spare a bit of land for a good friend, right?
- Oh, was that yours? Sorry!

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, neutral
- I had to take that land, no need to overreact.
- I needed that land, don't make a fuss.
- Don't worry, just needed a bit more land.
- I just needed that land, okay?
- Come on, don't make a big deal out of this.
- Hey, no hard feelings, right?
- Relax, it's not like I'm trying to wipe you off the map or anything.
- Just expanding a bit, don't take it personally now.
- Calm down, it's just a bit of land.
- It's not like you needed all that land anyway, right?

> invading, caused minor damage, stronger, hostile
- I needed that land, going to do anything about it?
- Yeah, yeah. I grabbed some of your land, big deal.
- Look, I take what I want, and I wanted that land.
- You should be glad I didn't take more.
- Oh, right, that was your land I guess. Well, not anymore.
- You didn't need that land anyway.
- I'm not apologizing for taking what I want. 
- Your fault for not defending that.
- Pff, cry me a river.
- Consider yourself lucky I didn't take more.
- Yeah no, that land is mine now. Deal with it.
- I'm just getting started.

#### b) from equal position

> invading, caused minor damage, similar strength, friendly
- I can have a bit more land, right?
- Surely you can spare a bit of land for me? Please?
- See, I really needed that bit of land. Don't be mad!
- Sorry about that, just really needed that land.
- I'll just grab this tiny piece of land over here... There we go, now I'm good!
- Oops, did you care about that piece of land? Sorry!
- Sorry for that little land grab, but that spot was really important to me.
- Ah, don't be so sour about it. Just a small piece of land.

> invading, caused minor damage, similar strength, neutral
- Hey, nothing personal, just needed that land.
- You know I needed that land, right? No need to get mad over it.
- I just needed that land, okay?
- Just a teensy tiny little land grab. No hard feelings, right?
- Ahem, let's not make this a big deal?
- If I say I'm sorry, will you leave me alone?
- I'm sorry, okay? I just needed that land.
- Sorry, had to take that. Let's not dwell on it.
- Come on, you know I didn't mean it.
- Don't be overly dramatic about this now, it's just a little bit of land.
- Sorry, I need to expand somewhere too!
- I need that land, sorry.
- Surely you don't care about that teensy-weensy little incursion?
- Just look at that land, it practically begged me to take it.

> invading, caused minor damage, similar strength, hostile
- Let's not start a big fight over this just yet.
- Pfft, like you care about a few bits of land.
- Want to start something bigger over this? Because I'm ready.
- Yeah, that's mine now.
- I can do much worse if you want.
- You should be glad that's all I took for now.
- Come on, that's barely worth fighting over.
- Just taking some land, but we can have a real war too if you want!
- No, I'm not done.
- Looks like you're giving away land for free. I'll take it!
- I mostly just needed that land, hurting you was a nice bonus though.
- You deserved to lose that land.
- I'm just getting started.
- This is just the beginning.

#### c) from weaker position

> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, friendly
- Look I really had to take that land. Please forgive me?
- Oh hi, please don't be mad? I just really needed to take that.
- I can have a bit more land, right, my friend?
- Oh no... Don't be mad!
- Oh crap, he noticed. I mean hi, sorry about that!
- Oh, you saw that? Sorry!
- Please forgive me, that piece of land is just really important to me.
- I promise I'll give it back later, okay?
- You said I could take that, right? Or did I misunderstand?
- Sorry! I'll make it up to you, I swear! 
 
> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, neutral
- Look I just need a bit more land, so have mercy?
- Uhh, surely you didn't care about that tiny bit of land?
- I just needed that land, okay? Please don't be mad.
- Uh, can you let it slide just this once?
- I'm sorry, okay? I just needed that land.
- Surely you have bigger things to worry about than little ol' me?
- So, uh, maybe I overstepped a little... Didn't mean to!
- Look, I didn't mean to steal your land. It just kind of happened.
- I promise I'm not going to take any more land, so can we call a truce?
- I suppose I was being a bit greedy, sorry.

> invading, caused minor damage, weaker, hostile
- I'm in trouble now, aren't I?
- Come on, you have better things to do.
- Come on, let this one slide.
- Huh, I guess you actually noticed. Unfortunate.
- I guess this may have been a mistake.
- Come on, you have bigger things to worry about.
- It's not like you'll miss that land anyway.
- Don't you have more important things to worry about?
- Come on, don't pretend like you cared about that bit of land.

### No good reason
> invading, caused major damage, stronger, was friendly
- I... Don't know what to say.
- Oh. This is awkward.
- Oops... I guess I got a bit carried away there.
- Oh no, how did that happen?
- Oh dear. I may have accidentally... Sorry!
- Whoops. Guess I should've thought twice before doing that...
- Oh. Oh no. I'm so sorry.
- That... was not supposed to happen.
- Oh my. I guess saying sorry doesn't quite cut it here, does it?
- Oh no. Sometimes I just do things without thinking.

> invading, caused major damage, was angered by nature, not hostile
- What can I say, sometimes I just can't help myself.
- Oops, I guess that was too tempting.
- Hehe... Sorry, I just couldn't resist.
- You were kind of asking for that, you know?
- Sorry, it was kind of an impulse decision.
- Well, what can I say, you were just too easy to conquer.
- I mean, just look at that land. It practically begged me to take it.
- See, I'm a conqueror. It's what I do.
- For glory!
- Ah, the thrill of conquest.
- To the victors go the spoils!
- Conquer and plunder, that's just how I like it.

> invading, caused major damage, stronger, not hostile
- Nothing personal, but you were kind of in the way.
- Sorry, have to look after my own interests.
- Sorry, but you were kind of a nuisance.
- Oh, did I just ruin your day? Wasn't really my intention, but oh well.
- How do I put it... You were a bit of an obstacle there.
- Don't take it personally, just had to do what was best for my kingdom.
- Sorry for trampling over your lands, but sometimes these things just happen.
- Sorry for taking over your lands, but hey, now you have less to worry about!
- Sorry, just figured I can make better use of that land.
- Sorry for ruining your plans, but I have my own to take care of.

#### Motivation to STOP fighting

> suffered damage, not hostile, common enemy 
- We should stop this fight, we have a bigger problem brewing.
- Our common foe smiles as we fight. We should stop this.
- You sure you want to keep fighting ME?
- You sure I'm still your biggest problem?
- Think about it, we could be allies if you weren't so damn stubborn.
- What do you say we put down our swords and call a truce?
- We have more important battles to fight than this petty feud.
- Wouldn't you rather fight alongside me than against me?
- Open your eyes, we have a bigger problem than one another.
- Put down your sword, let's focus on the real enemy.
- Don't you have a bigger fish to fry? I know I do.
- Let's not waste our energy on each other when we have a bigger problem to solve.
- Why don't we join forces instead and focus on the bigger picture?

- Look, I COULD leave you alone... If you do the same.
- Don't you have better things to do than fight me?
- Look, I'm willing to move past this if you are.
- Let's call it even?
- Why don't we talk this through like civilized people?
- If we keep fighting, we'll both lose in the end.
- Come on, I don't want to fight you.
- I'm willing to make a truce. Are you?
- Let's stop this before things get out of hand.
- If we keep this up, neither of us will win. 

> suffered damage, not hostile, weaker
- I don't enjoy this fight at all...
- Any chance you could leave me alone?
- Any chance of a truce?
- Could we, uh, call it a tie and go our separate ways?
- Do we really have to keep fighting?
- Maybe we can find some common ground?
- Fine, you win. Can we stop now?
- Wouldn't peace be better than war?
