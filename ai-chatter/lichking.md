## Simplified chatter for the "Lich King" AI persona

> suffered major damage, angry reaction, not weaker
- You think you can challenge the master of death?
- Your army marches to its doom.
- I am eternal! Your efforts are in vain, mortal.
- Your bravery is futile, mortal.
- Your victory will be short-lived, for I am death incarnate.
- Your attacks are like whispers in a hurricane, insignificant and fleeting.
- In the end, it is you who will despair, not I.
- You'll see the futility of your efforts soon enough.
- I am eternal, unyielding, and I will outlast you in the end.
- I am the master of life and death, your resistance is futile.
- With each strike, you draw closer to your own demise.

> suffered major damage, angry reaction, much weaker
- The darkness will rise again, and your fleeting resistance will be but a memory in the void!
- In the end, you shall all serve me in the afterlife!
- Your fleeting triumph is but a speck in the grand tapestry of my undying existence.
- Strike me down as many times as you wish, but I'll always rise again.
- I will rise again, and the world will kneel before my power!
- Your victory is temporary; my determination is eternal.

> caused major damage
- Witness the might of the undead!
- Welcome to the end of days.
- Your fate is sealed.
- You can't withstand the tide of the dead.
- Behold the power of the eternal night!
- Pathetic mortals.
- Your defeat was written in the stars, your lands destined for oblivion.

- The darkness will consume you. There's no escape!

> not weaker
- Embrace the void that awaits you.
- You can't withstand the tide of the dead.
- Your existence is nothing but a fleeting shadow.
- Mere mortal, your struggle is in vain.
- Your arrival was foretold, as was your demise. Welcome to the abyss.
- The living are but fleeting flames, while I am the eternal darkness.
- Death's embrace is inevitable.
- Face oblivion!
- Your hope is futile, for in the end, all things succumb to the embrace of death.
- You face a force beyond mortal comprehension. 
- Death is my ally, and I am its harbinger.

> weaker
- You underestimate the depths of my determination. 
- I am unyielding, undying. You cannot destroy what cannot be broken.
- What is dead my never die.
- You'll never escape the shadow I cast upon your world.
- You think you can vanquish the master of death? Think again.
- I will not yield to the likes of you, even in the face of annihilation.
- I am an eternal force, I shall never bow to the likes of you!
- You can't change the course of destiny, I am its architect.
